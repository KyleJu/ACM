ACM Week 5 
Question 1 - used brute force method - convert all string into number at once
             solution: covert individually and put them into array
	   - inputting as string gives you more options
	   - use print(), rather than println because println has space on the bottom
	   - print is always preferred
Better solution: create an counter for array from 0 - 9 int[9]. You donâ€™t have to sort, all you need to do is to starting from the highest number and print them out.
