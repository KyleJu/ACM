1.index%8 to get the integer when index > 8!!
3. diagnols - it is always square in coordinate system
   read questions more carefully - mushroom comes out every second - so you can just iterate through and stop once you find enough mushrooms
   y-y1/x-x1 = 1 or -1 - diagnols for square - think about math
2. Question 2: Character.toString(input.charAt(k)) == j. You convert char into String 
   - Learn to do test case and debugging 
   - Char has unicode value
	char c = 'a';
	int i = c;
	System.out.println(Integer.toHexString(i));
   -    String l = String.valueOf(input.charAt(k));
         if (l.equals("J")) - use equals!!!!!!!
